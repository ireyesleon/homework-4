This is an application for a simple geography quiz, it's structured so when the user clicks start a countdown begins, if the user selects a wrong option then 5 seconds are substracted from the countdown. After the user answers all the questions the score is diplayed and the user can put his initials and save them. The highscore page was not completed yet but it will show a list of the initials and their scores.
